This is the main page for `github.com/jpacie`. All of the programs I will make on here will be in my free time, as a hobby, meaning I am under no obligation to continue/complete any programs I start/create.
This github will be open for any contributions that I deem useable and beneficial.
I will post unfinished work, in hope that the community can help and be beneficial to the development of my/the communuty's programs.
This unfinished work will not interfere with the finished branches of the repos.
